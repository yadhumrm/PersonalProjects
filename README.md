# PersonalProjects : PhotoViewer

# This is an individal project to showcase how to consume an a online image library (we use unsplash in this project).

* How to use ?
      * Run the application.
      * In the launch screen you could see a text box, in which you can provide your 'unsplash' account username OR 
          you can continue with the already provided account for the demo.
      * Once you provide a valid 'unsplash' user name (or decided to go with the default username) press "Continue" button.
      * On completion of the successfull request you will be taken to the home page which shows the liked images 
        in the account provided.
      * Click on any image to view the details, and you will be taken to the details page.
      * In details page you can view the full-sized image, its description and download the same to your photo library.
      
* Third party libraries used.
    * User cocoa pods as dependancy manager for the integration of third party libraries.
    * Networking : A network library used for making network calls.
    * SVProgressHUD : A library to show progress, success and error on completion of long running tasks.
          
      
* What to improve if i had more time.
     * Will be adding localizations for multiple languages.
     * Will be implementing share option inthe app to share the images.
     * would have implemented the interaction with other APIs of unspash to bring more featutes like "favourite", 
          "remove from favourite"
     * would have implemented login for unspash to consume more apis and features.
     * made UIs more attactive with more animations and other components.
